# Crop-Damage-Simulation-End-to-End-ML-Pipeline
This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a data science workflow — from custom Python modules that generate randomized datasets with embedded biases to mimic real-world agricultural scenarios, through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development, all the way to evaluation and stakeholder storytelling.
